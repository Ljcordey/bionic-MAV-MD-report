# Bionic principles applied to MAV design





## Introduction

Over the last few years there has been a huge boom in the micro air vehicle (MAV) market, making them accessible for a wide range of people and purposes like surveillance, delivery of goods, photographing and many more. Our company has recognized the potential of MAVs and revolutionizes it by transforming a micro air vehicle to a micro amphibious vehicle.  



## Scoping

For the Scoping of the project we referred to the biomimicry modeling wheel (Fig.1). It allowed us to structure our scoping into three distinctive categories:

- Context definition
- Function identification
- Life's principle integration

### Context definition

We identified two main contextual areas for our project, and several sub-context, while also considering a transitional context.



The following table summarizes our work in this regard.



| **AIR**                                                      | **TRANSITION**      | **WATER**                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **WEATHER**<br /> SUNLIGHT<br /> TEMPERATURE<br /> HUMIDITY <br />RAIN<br /> WIND<br /> ICE&SNOW | **DENSITY**         | **CONDITIONS**<br/>water<br/> current<br/> waves             |
| **HAZARDS**<br/> animals/insects<br/> moving objects<br/> abrasives<br/> people | **SURFACE TENSION** | **HAZARDS**<br/> animals<br/> moving objects                 |
| **TOPOLOGY**<br/> mountains<br/> forests<br/> glaciers<br/> buildings |                     | **TOPOLOGY**<br/> lake/river<br/> depth<br/> stones/rocks<br/> plants |
|                                                              |                     |                                                              |



### Function's identification

To have a better grasp on what the MAV will have to be able to perform, it's functions had to be placed within their contexts (Fig.2).

### Life's principle integration

When looking at how to integrate/use natural engineering solution, we identified the following Life's principle that we wanted to integrate into the project:

1. adapt to changing conditions
2. Change between air and water
3. Temperature change
4. Altitude change
5. be resource efficient
6. Navigation for over and underwater

## Discovering

The discovering phase is all about understanding the technical solutions that the natural world has to offer after millions of years of natural evolution.


The objective was to find applicable biological models or answers to the issues and functions that the MAV would have to overcome/perform. 

### Natural Model discovery

We approached this trough so called "*lenses*", which encapsulate abstract questions into itemizable bits.

so far, we looked through the following lenses:

- **Function Lense**
  How would nature communicate under water / in the air?

  How would nature transition from air to water?

  How would nature navigate under water?

- **Ecological Lens**
  water, air, animals

- **Operating Conditions**
  freezing water, high altitude changes

- **Naturalist Lens**





### Abstracted Biological Strategies

Looking for interesting biological solutions to our problems, we identified the following:

- *Water Strides* – Communication by vibration
- *Brown Pelican* – Beak slices into surface at high speed
- *Big Brown Bats* – Navigating via sonar
- *Garden warbler* – Navigation via magnetic fields
- *Spiders* – Flying with silk in negativly charged surface
- *Goldenrod Gall Fly* – Internal antifreeze protein
